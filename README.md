# UE4_Course_04_BattleTank
An open world head-to-head tank fight with simple AI, terrain, and advanced control system in Unreal 4

This is the current section of the Gamedev.tv course (on Udemy) I am working through, as of the 13th June 2018.

I will be stepping outside of the course materials, by attempting to create in game 3D model assets with Blender. I am doing this as a means to cement my knowledge of the Gamedev.tv Blender course I am also taking.

##My current Gamedev.tv / Udemy courses
* Learn 3D Modelling - The Complete Blender Creator Course
* The Unreal Engine Developer Course
